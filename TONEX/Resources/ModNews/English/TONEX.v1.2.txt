We Support English Again!
To express our gratitude for the support of our players over the past year, we are pleased to present three version-restricted offerings!
Happy first anniversary to TOHEX! Also, wishing everyone a happy 520(520 means I LOVE YOU) day. 
Whether you have a lover, a yandere, a secret admirer, or even a akujo, may you all have a joyous time, as long as you're not the akujo's backup. 
But I believe that Cupid's arrow of love will eventually find its way to you!
